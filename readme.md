# RustMorse
RustMorse is a translator, trainer, and game for learning morse code.

This project is to practice and learn Rust. It will be built on Amethyst, a data-oriented game engine written in Rust. Amethyst is a very powerful solution for generating a GUI, a bit overpowered for my use case. But presents a fun challenge and a useful tool for future projects.

I used some of the functionality from the crate [Mors](https://docs.rs/crate/mors/0.1.1), but chose to write it out myself rather than just use the crate as a whole.
